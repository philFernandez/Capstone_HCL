## Some Notes on Testing and Running

You will need to go into `application.properties` and change the setting
pertaining to JDBC and database to match those of your system. Currently
This project is setup to use MySql 8, with a database called `Simpli`. 
MySql is required because of the dependencies laid out in the `pom.xml`
but the database name, username, and password can be changed to meet 
the needs of the person testing. All database setup beyond this is
done automatically by the backend. Website user is added, products
are added, etc. See [above](#Test-User-and-Password) for default website username and password.
